                              As the 21st century enters, technology can be seen in every corner of the world. Manâ€™s desire for fast, reliable and accurate production of data is now a must in a modern manner of learning. It is clear that Information Communication Technology (ICT) is inevitably growing and inspiring new developments.  Through the help of technology developers are able to make a system that will surely meet their needs.

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;text-align:justify;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">The NBC 461 (QCE) Qualitative Contribution Evaluation and (CCE) Common Criteria for Evaluation for Self-Evaluation is intended for Instructor and Professor as a tool for evaluating, computing, monitoring the performance of IT faculty thus maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of evaluation. It was created and developed by the EVSU IT students Aira Lago, Stefany Omlang and Kristyl Jane Pesidas. The System Developer decided that data will be kept on the web so that it will be easily accessible anywhere.</p>

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;text-align:justify;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">The importance of providing a fast and accurate system for the computation of QCE and CCE is a favourable factor for the faculty which could create an effective process in terms of calculating a massive QCE. Since integrity of source data is preserved and manual preparation of evaluation data is eliminated, it will result to a more accurate input data, shorter processing time, and reduced manpower requirements. Student participation is increased. All students have a chance of evaluating all the teachers handling their enrolled courses. The result of the teacher evaluation is, therefore, based on the perception of the majority of students and not limited to the previous 20% sample class size.</p>

                            <p style="text-indent:15px;text-align:justify;margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px">The admin account is managed by the head of the department who is authorized to evaluate, check, manage the QCE and CCE evaluation and register faculty and students. The main users are the faculty and students who serve as the evaluator, wherein the admin or head has a full access in the system while the faculty is only allowed to evaluate themselves and peers, preview the result, print the QCE and CCE reports.</p>
